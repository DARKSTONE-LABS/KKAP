Now, you might think, "What if I need to extract some of those juicy PENNIES?" Fear not, for the 'Unshove' function is here. You can withdraw your PENNIES, but beware, it comes with a catch—a 50% fee. Half your PENNIES vanish into the ether (quite literally), a small sacrifice for disturbing the peace of your Butthole. 

But for those who like to live dangerously, there’s an even more thrilling option: burn your Butthole. Yes, you heard that right. Set your Butthole ablaze (metaphorically speaking, of course), and you can claim all your PENNIES, no fee attached. It’s a bold move for those who believe in going out with a bang!

The fun doesn't stop there. Each minting of a Butthole isn't just a transaction; it's a ritual that contributes to the greater good. Part of your minting fee is whisked away to the mystical land of Uniswap, where it’s paired with an equal amount of PENNIES to create a liquidity pool. It's like creating a cosmic soup of assets, simmering in the cauldron of decentralized finance.

In this bizarre bazaar, the total supply of PENNIES is capped at a cool 1 billion. Because in the world of Buttholes, even infinity has its limits. It’s an ecosystem where scarcity rules, and the balance of power is maintained by the sacred law of supply and demand.

So there you have it, folks—the Butthole Contract. A place where humor meets finance, where the absurd dances with the sublime, and where the blockchain becomes a playground for the wild, the wacky, and the wealthy. Strap in, for you're in for a ride that's anything but ordinary. Welcome to the future—it's weirder than you think!
